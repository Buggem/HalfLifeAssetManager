# Changelog for Version 3

[< Back to CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

## Changes in V3.0.0

### Installer changes

* Properly convert slashes to backslashes in file type registration to fix file type associations not working properly
* Added progid to avoid use of autogenerated id in file type associations

### Bug fixes

* Set the locale to `en_US` to match game behavior. This fixes numeric input widgets not accepting the same inputs as the game and other tools
* Fixed mirror model not accounting for ground height
* Fixed shadow height not matching ground height. The shadow is now rendered on the ground if the ground is below the model origin, matching the game's behavior
* Always render the ground after main scene to match original behavior. This fixes the ground sometimes changing transparency when changing camera angles
* Fixed importing texture with different dimensions breaking UV coordinates when the model has multiple skins used on the same mesh
* Fixed Transparent Screenshots setting not saving correctly
* Fixed texture filter settings not syncing properly when loaded
* Draw scene in separate framebuffer with transparent black background to avoid background color bleeding through when Transparent Screenshots are enabled
    * **Note**: this bug fix requires the use of OpenGL framebuffers. In OpenGL version 2.1 this is provided as an extension. If your driver does not support framebuffers then the Transparent Screenshots feature will be disabled
* Removed alpha channel from main OpenGL window. This fixes the content behind the program window showing when certain 3D elements are rendered when running in a virtual machine

### User interface changes

* Excluded Qt diagnostics output from messages panel by default

### Project changes

* Added Linux version
* Updated Github Actions to use Node.js 20-based versions
* Added CPack configuration to enable the creation of Debian packages on Linux. See [README.md](../README.md) for more information
