To create a PDF from the HalfLifeAssetManagerManual.tex you need to use a PDF to LaTeX compiler.

The manual was created using [MiKTeX]()https://miktex.org) and [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker).
MiKTeX provides the required compiler and acts as a package manager, Texmaker uses it and largely automates the process.
